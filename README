The directory structure:

./bin      -- contains compiler binares

Build instructions:
To build the parser binary, type:

make

To run the parser in a smlnj test environment, type

make test

The parser executable expects a file on stdin.
It will then dump an AST on stdout. The example
files should all parse correctly.
