DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

./bin      -- contains compiler binares and test script
./src      -- contains compiler helper/driver code
./tiger    -- contains Tiger grammar files
./examples -- contains example Tiger files

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
To build the parser binary, type:

make

The parser executable expects a file on stdin.
It will then dump an AST on stdout. The example
files should all parse correctly.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
A test executable is located at ./bin/test
To run the test executable, build the parser first.
To test how small snippets of code would be parsed,
simply pass the snippet in as a string argument.

HACKING INSTRUCTIONS:
This is only a parser. The main parser driver code is
contained in src/parser.sml. This would be the file to
look at/modify to hook the parser into a full-blown 
compiler.
