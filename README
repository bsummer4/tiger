# Build Instructions
To build the parser binary, type:

| make

The parser executable expects a file on stdin.  It will then dump an
AST on stdout. The example files should all parse correctly.

# Test Instructions
A test executable is located at ./bin/test To run the test executable,
build the parser first.  To test how small snippets of code would be
parsed, simply pass the snippet in as a string argument.
