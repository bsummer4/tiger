# Building
We are using plan9 mk for building.  It is available on most Linux distros
as a package named 'mk' or in either the '9base' or 'plan9port' packages.
To build all the executables, run:

	| mk

# Reading
The bulk of the code is in /src.  The *.sml files at the root bind things
together to produce the various executables.

All files should begin with a comment explaining what they are for,
so doing `head *' should provide a nice summary.  Documentation is a
bit sparse right now since the overall design isn't finished.
