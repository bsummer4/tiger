:TODO: Issue with SML/NJ modules:
	When the parser.sml driver is in a different module from the parser code
   we get errors in SML/NJ:

	| parser.sml:2.2-2.15 Error: unbound structure: LrParser

	This can be resolved by adding '$/ml-yacc-lib.cm' to the argument list
	when invoking sml/nj.

	| sml src/tiger.cm '$/ml-yacc-lib.cm' parse.sml

	The ml-yacc `.cm' file is included in `src/tiger.cm', but it seems to be
	unavailable from outside.

:TODO: Some Tiger Issues
	- Nil cannot be used with arrays
	- Funky tiger strings need to be handled in the parser.
	- Nil can only be used in a context where it's record type can
	  be determined.

:TODO: Write a makefile rule to run the each-file-on-a-line tests
	cat ex/small_valid | (i=0; while read x; do echo "%% $x"; echo $x | ./o.parse; done) | less

:TODO: Some style stuff
	- IR.#ref' vs CIR.#isRef
	- Functional record update
	- Fold in {src/ll.sml}

:TODO: Lexer bug
	`4*5' works, but `4 * 5' doesn't

:TODO: IR -> CIR
