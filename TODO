:TODO: Issue with SML/NJ modules:
	When the parser.sml driver is in a different module from the parser code
   we get errors in SML/NJ:

	| parser.sml:2.2-2.15 Error: unbound structure: LrParser

:TODO: README should talk about directory layout
	(driver files at the root.  )

:TODO: doc/* in troff
	Generate output with 'marks', and the tweak it so that it looks nice.
	This should probably be added as a header:

		| .TL
		| Tiger Language Tutorial
		| .AU
		| Aaron Mishtal
		| Stephen Skeirik
		| Benjamin Summers
		| .2C

:TODO: SML/NJ Doesn't like util.sml
	Wrap it in a struct and open it as needed
