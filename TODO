:TODO: Issue with SML/NJ modules:
	When the parser.sml driver is in a different module from the parser code
   we get errors in SML/NJ:

:TODO: README should talk about directory layout

:TODO: sa.sml doesn't work
	It's just scaffolding for now anyways, but it should be fixed

:TODO: doc/* in troff
	Generate output with 'marks', and the tweak it so that it looks nice.
	This should probably be added as a header:

		| Tiger Language Tutorial
		| .AU
		| Aaron Mishtal
		| Stephen Skeirik
		| Benjamin Summers
		| .2C
