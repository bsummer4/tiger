:TODO: Issue with SML/NJ modules:
	When the parser.sml driver is in a different module from the parser code
   we get errors in SML/NJ:

	| parser.sml:2.2-2.15 Error: unbound structure: LrParser

:TODO: README should talk about directory layout
	(driver files at the root.  )

:TODO: sa.sml doesn't work
	It's just scaffolding for now anyways, but it should be fixed
