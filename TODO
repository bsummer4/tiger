:TODO: Issue with SML/NJ modules:
	When the parser.sml driver is in a different module from the parser code
   we get errors in SML/NJ:

	| parser.sml:2.2-2.15 Error: unbound structure: LrParser

	This can be resolved by adding '$/ml-yacc-lib.cm' to the argument list
	when invoking sml/nj.

	| sml src/tiger.cm '$/ml-yacc-lib.cm' parse.sml

	The ml-yacc `.cm' file is included in `src/tiger.cm', but it seems to be
	unavailable from outside.
