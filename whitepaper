:NOTES:
	Some quotes from the book:
		- "A simple but nontrivial language in the Algol family."
		- "Nested scope and heap-allocated records."
		- "Tiger is easily modified to be functional, object-oriented, or both".
		- "A small language with nested functions, record values with implicit
		   pointer, array, integer and string variables, and a few simple
		   structure control constructs."

	- Main Premise: Tiger is a good language for learning to write compilers.
		- Easy to parse
		- Easy to learn
		- Good language for a compilers class.
		- Simple semantics
		- Compiles easily to C.
		- Lots of room for extensions and optimizations.
